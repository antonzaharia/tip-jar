# tip-jar

In this first project I've added a tip jar to a portfolio website â€“ a super simple way to accept money without having to use PayPal, Stripe, or any other payment gateway.
I've done so to:
- lay the groundwork on what exactly crypto is,
- understand how to would use Ethereum,
- understand how to connect a digital wallet to the Ethereum blockchain,
- and to understand how to transfer Ether payments to other digital accounts.
